# Shelf

> A board that is always floating on the screen to help with the process of organizing and maintaining code.

Most of the time after debugging or implementing a new feature I find myself with the same intrusive act of having to organize and clean up my code. In light of doing this, I found that I refer back to basic comment blocks of code that help me better organize my code by separating it into sections.
