# Shelf

> A board that is always floating on screen to help with the process of organizing and maintaining code.

Most of the time after debugging or implementing a new feature i find myslef with the same intrusef act of having to orgainze and clean up my code. In light of doing this i found that i refer back to basic comment blocks of code that help me better organize my code by seperating it into sections.
